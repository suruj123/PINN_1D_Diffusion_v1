# PINN_1D_Diffusion_v1
A  physics informed neural network is created to solve the diffusion eqation in 1D. The PINN predicts the output at later times very accuarately. But at the begining, the prediction is not correct. The reason behind this needs to be find out.

The performance of the nueral network improves with the increases in the number of epochs. For 4500 epochs, the contour plot and the line plot is added to the repository and the name of the files are respectively, "Contour_plot_1d_diffusion_ep4500.png" and "Line_plot_1d_diff_ep4500.png". Simllarly, for 13450 and 18400 epochs, corresponding figures are added to the repository. With more number of epochs not only at the end of the simulations, we get higher level of accuracy in the begining of the simulation also.
